    "title": "How the Denver Broncos Went From Super Bowl Champions to a Struggling Offense",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Denver Broncos have been a rollercoaster ride for the last decade. From the high of winning Super Bowl 50 with Peyton Manning in 2015 to the frustration of the ongoing eight-year playoff drought, it’s hard to ignore the apparent contrast. Manning’s final season was a fairytale ending for one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play the game. But after he left, it feels like the magic disappeared.\nIf you’re a Broncos fan, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Sure, they’ve had some moments, but overall? It’s been a long, tough stretch. Here’s the thing–when you really break down the numbers, it’s even worse than it seems. So, let’s dive into some stats and see how much the Broncos’ offense has struggled since Super Bowl 50.\nLet’s start with the offensive yards because, let’s face it, that’s the heart of the game. The data shows a vast difference between before and after the 2015 season. The bar chart below shows the total offensive yards for the Broncos from 2012 to 2023. Notice the massive spike in 2013? A whopping 8622 yards, and you know what? That was Peyton Manning in his prime with many of his offensive teammates producing big numbers. The offense was in sync, the weapons fired, and everything clicked.\nThen, it’s like someone flipped a switch. After Super Bowl 50, the Broncos’ offensive yards just plummeted. Even though the team was fresh off a Super Bowl win, without Manning, the offense started to struggle. And, the numbers haven’t really bounced back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers don’t lie. Manning’s departure left a gaping hole in Denver’s offensive play. That 2013 peak was the high point; since then, it’s been all downhill. And we’re not just talking about a slight dip–this is a dramatic drop in offensive production.\nIf the drop in total offensive yards wasn’t a big enough pill to swallow, the Broncos’ passing efficiency tells an even bigger story. Despite the Super Bowl win, Denver’s passing game sharply declined from 2014 to 2015, which became even more apparent after Manning’s retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the thing: Manning, nearing the end of his career, wasn’t the same quarterback as he was in his prime. Sure, the Broncos’ stellar defense stepped up in a big way that season, playing a massive role in the win. But the offense was no longer what it once was, and as Manning’s time with the team came to a close, the Broncos were left searching for the following offensive identity.\nSince Manning’s retirement, the Broncos have gone through quarterbacks in an attempt to find a leader who could recapture the offensive spark of the past. From Trevor Siemian to Case Keenum, Joe Flacco to Drew Lock, and eventually Teddy Bridgewater and Russell Wilson, it has been a revolving door of quarterbacks, each one offering brief glimpses of hope before falling short. While a handful of other quarterbacks also played during this period, these key figures offered brief glimpses of hope before ultimately falling short in securing long-term success for the franchise.\nLet’s take a closer look at how Denver’s quarterbacks have fared since Manning. Below is a table of key players who have led the Broncos offense from 2012-2023. As you’ll notice, Manning’s success stands out clearly from the others. Even though quarterbacks like Russell Wilson were expected to be the solution, Denver has still struggled to find consistency and stability at the position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA decade of quarterback changes in Denver\n\n\nInconsistent quarterback play in the aftermath of Manning's retirement\n\n\nPlayer\nRecord\nTouchdowns\nInterceptions\n\n\n\n\nPeyton Manning\n50-14\n140\n53\n\n\nTrevor Siemian\n13-11\n30\n24\n\n\nCase Keenum\n6-10\n18\n15\n\n\nJoe Flacco\n2-6\n6\n5\n\n\nDrew Lock\n8-13\n25\n20\n\n\nTeddy Bridgewater\n7-7\n18\n7\n\n\nRussell Wilson\n11-19\n42\n19\n\n\n\nBy: Maddie Meyerle | Source: Sports-Reference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team has cycled through quarterbacks, each offering glimpses of hope but needing more stability to bring the Broncos back to playoff contention. Even with a proven veteran like Russell Wilson, the offense has struggled to regain the spark it had in Manning’s prime. It’s been a tough stretch for Denver, and finding a leader at quarterback remains the key to their future success.\nBut the future may not be as bleak as it seems. Bo Nix, a promising young quarterback, could be the answer the Broncos have been looking for. With his strong rookie performance, Nix represents the hope that Denver’s search for stability at the position might finally come to an end.\nWhile it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions, Nix’s early signs of success suggest that he might be the quarterback who can finally turn things around for the Broncos. With the right development, he could be the player who brings the team back into playoff contention and restores hope for the future."

    "title": "How did Christian McCaffrey’s mid-season addition to the San Francisco 49ers in 2022 impact their offensive performance and team success?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2022, Christian McCaffrey made headlines when he was traded from the Carolina Panthers to the San Francisco 49ers. This move proved to be a game-changer for the team, as McCaffrey became an essential weapon for the 49ers’ offense. McCaffrey was acquired on October 20, 2022, in exchange for draft picks in 2023 and 2024 and made his debut in Week 7 against the Kansas City Chiefs. From there, he quickly became a full-time starter and a key contributor for the 49ers, adding another layer of excitement to their offensive game plan.\nBefore McCaffrey’s arrival, the 49ers were 3-3, but the trade gave them the spark they needed. By the end of the regular season, the team was sitting at 13-4, ultimately finishing with a 15-5 record. McCaffrey’s impact was undeniable, not only through his incredible rushing abilities but also his receiving skills. He became the first 49ers running back to record passing, rushing, and receiving touchdowns in a single game. This versatility made him a true threat, and his consistency after becoming a full-time starter in Week 8 played a huge role in the team’s success.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cran.rstudio.com/\"))\nlibrary(nflfastR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npbp_data &lt;- load_pbp(season = 2022)\n\nmccaffrey_data &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(rusher == \"C.McCaffrey\" | receiver == \"C.McCaffrey\") |&gt;\n  group_by(game_date) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    receiving_yards = sum(receiving_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(rushing_yards, receiving_yards),\n               names_to = \"yard_type\",\n               values_to = \"yards\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(yards))\n\nfirst_game &lt;- as.Date(\"2022-10-23\")\n\nmccaffrey_data$game_date &lt;- as.Date(mccaffrey_data$game_date)\n\ndate_seq &lt;- seq(from = min(mccaffrey_data$game_date),\n                to = max(mccaffrey_data$game_date),\n                by = \"month\")\n\nggplot(mccaffrey_data, aes(x = game_date, y = yards, color = yard_type)) +\n  geom_line(size = .8) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(first_game), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = first_game + 5,\n           y = max(mccaffrey_data$yards) * 0.85,\n           label = \"McCaffrey's\\nfirst game\\nwith the 49ers\",\n           color = \"black\",\n           size = 2.5,\n           angle = 0,\n           hjust = 0,\n           vjust = 0) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Christian McCaffrey's yardage breakdown for 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"Tracking yards before and after McCaffrey's debut with\\nSan Francisco\",\n    caption = \"By: Maddie Meyerle | Source: nflverse\",\n    x = \"Game Date\",\n    y = \"Yards\",\n    color = \"Yard Type\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"receiving_yards\" = \"#B3995D\", \"rushing_yards\" = \"#AA0000\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Receiving Yards\", \"Rushing Yards\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = date_seq, date_labels = \"%b %Y\", expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCaffrey’s contribution to the 49ers’ offense was evident in his performance on the field. Throughout the 2022 season, McCaffrey’s rushing and receiving yards fluctuated, with some games seeing impressive yardage and others where his output was more modest. This variation shows the dynamic nature of McCaffrey’s role within the team, as he adapted to different defensive schemes and played an important part in both ground and passing attacks.\nBefore McCaffrey’s arrival, the 49ers’ offensive yardage was solid but didn’t reach the level of explosiveness it achieved with him on the roster. The numbers highlight how much the team’s offensive game changed, with a clear spike in both rushing and passing yards after McCaffrey joined. While his contributions were a huge factor, the overall offensive balance also shifted dramatically.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nafter_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2022-10-23\")\n\nbefore_data &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(posteam == \"SF\" & game_date &lt; after_date) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_passing_yards = sum(passing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nafter_data &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(posteam == \"SF\" & game_date &gt;= after_date) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_passing_yards = sum(passing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nbefore &lt;- c(\"Rushing\" = 744, \"Passing\" = 1347)\nafter &lt;- c(\"Rushing\" = 1991, \"Passing\" = 3345)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    before / 25, \n    rows = 5, \n    colors = c(\"#AA0000\", \"black\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"The McCaffrey effect on San Franciso's yardage\",\n      subtitle = \"A visual comparison of the 49er's rushing and passing yards &lt;span style='color:#AA0000'&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; and&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style='color:#B3995D'&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; McCaffrey's first game with the team\",\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n      plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown()\n    ),\n  waffle(\n    after / 25, \n    rows = 12, \n    colors = c(\"#B3995D\", \"#000000\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 25 yards\",\n      caption = \"By: Maddie Meyerle | Source: nflverse\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of McCaffrey’s arrival can be seen in how the team’s rushing and passing yards changed. Before his trade, the 49ers had 744 rushing yards and 1,347 passing yards. After McCaffrey’s debut, these numbers increased significantly, with 1,991 rushing yards and 3,345 passing yards. This chart shows the dramatic shift in offensive production.\nLooking at the contributions of the other 49ers running backs in the regular season provides an interesting perspective on how McCaffrey stood out. With several key running backs on the roster, it’s clear that McCaffrey was a dominant force. The yardage comparison shows that while other running backs had solid performances, McCaffrey’s contribution far exceeded his teammates.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nrunningbacks &lt;- \n  read_csv(\"data/niners2022.csv\")\n\nplayers_of_interest &lt;- c(\"Christian McCaffrey\", \"Jeff Wilson\", \"Elijah Mitchell\", \"Jordan Mason\", \"Tyrion Davis-Price\", \"Tevin Coleman\")\n\nfiltered_rb &lt;- runningbacks |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% players_of_interest) |&gt;\n  select(Player, RushYds, RecYds)\n\nlong_data &lt;- filtered_rb |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"RushYds\", \"RecYds\"),\n    names_to = \"Yard_Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot(long_data, aes(\n  x = Player,\n  y = Yards,\n  fill = Yard_Type\n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"McCaffrey's dominance among the 49er's running\\nbacks during the regular season\",\n    subtitle = \"Exploring how McCaffrey's rushing and receiving yards set him apart\\nfrom his fellow teammates in 2022\",\n    caption = \"Source: By: Maddie Meyerle | Sports-Reference.com\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Yards\",\n    fill = \"Yard Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"RushYds\" = \"#AA0000\", \"RecYds\" = \"#B3995D\"),\n                    labels = c(\"RushYds\" = \"Rushing\", \"RecYds\" = \"Receiving\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCaffrey’s contribution stands out when comparing the yardage among the 49ers’ running backs in the regular season. While others like Jeff Welson added value, McCaffrey’s total rushing and receiving yards surpassed the rest of the team’s running backs. This chart illustrates how much McCaffrey elevated the team’s offensive production, providing a reliable and dynamic option.\nAs San Francisco moved into the playoffs, McCaffrey remained a key factor in their offensive success. The team’s overall performance was instrumental in their playoff run, and McCaffrey’s contributions didn’t slow down.\n\n\nCode\nplayoffs &lt;- \n  read_csv(\"data/playoff2022.csv\")\n\nplayers_of_interest &lt;- c(\"Christian McCaffrey\", \"Elijah Mitchell\", \"Jordan Mason\")\n\nfiltered_playoffs &lt;- playoffs |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% players_of_interest) |&gt;\n  select(Player, RushYds, RecYds)\n\nlong_data &lt;- filtered_playoffs |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"RushYds\", \"RecYds\"),\n    names_to = \"Yard_Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot(long_data, aes(\n  x = Player,\n  y = Yards,\n  fill = Yard_Type\n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"McCaffrey continues to dominate in the playoffs\",\n    subtitle = \"McCaffrey's impressive rushing and receiving yards alongside\\nother 49er's running backs\",\n    caption = \"By: Maddie Meyerle | Sports-Reference.com\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Yards\",\n    fill = \"Yard Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"RushYds\" = \"#AA0000\", \"RecYds\" = \"#B3995D\"),\n                    labels = c(\"RushYds\" = \"Rushing\", \"RecYds\" = \"Receiving\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the playoffs, McCaffrey’s yardage continued to dominate, just as it had in the regular season. His performance was significant in the 49ers’ playoff run. This chart compares his yardage with the rest of the running backs on the team during this time.\nMcCaffrey’s trade to the San Francisco 49ers in 2022 was a transformative moment for the team. His ability to contribute as both a rusher and receiver allowed the 49ers to become a more dynamic offense, and his consistency helped elevate the team to a 15-5 record by the end of the season.\nWhile McCaffrey’s individual achievements are impressive, it’s important to recognize the overall team effort. The 49ers’ defense ranked #1 by the end of the season and played a vital role in the team’s success. McCaffrey’s explosive playmaking ability and the defense’s dominance helped the 49ers go far in the playoffs."
